2
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.978
So back at the start of the course,
we encountered the apples and

3
00:00:05.978 --> 00:00:07.530
bananas problems.

4
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.640
How to find the price of things
when we only have the total bill.

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.450
And we've looked at vectors so far.

6
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.854
And now we're going to look at matrices.

7
00:00:14.854 --> 00:00:19.020
And these are objects that rotate and
stretch vectors.

8
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.070
But they're also objects that let
us solve these sorts of problems.

9
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.950
So let's go back to that apples and
bananas problem.

10
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.320
Say I walk into a shop and
I buy two apples, and three bananas,

11
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.190
and that that costs 8 euros.

12
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.710
So I'm saying 2 apples,
3 bananas, cost 8 euros.

13
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.347
Now say I go to the shop on another
day and I buy 10 apples and 1 banana.

14
00:00:46.347 --> 00:00:49.727
And that that costs me, or
the shopkeeper charges me 13 euros.

15
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.270
And I want to discover what the price for
1 apple and 1 banana is, so

16
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.269
I can decide which offers better value or
even just predict my bill.

17
00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.134
Now you might say this is silly.

18
00:01:02.134 --> 00:01:04.870
What shop doesn't have
sticker prices after all?

19
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.544
But actually in business with complicated
products and service agreements and

20
00:01:08.544 --> 00:01:12.288
higher purchase, this sort of thing,
price discovery, happens all the time.

21
00:01:12.288 --> 00:01:15.350
Think about what happens when
you buy a car for instance.

22
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.760
Now these are just simultaneous equations,
but I can write them down in another way.

23
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:28.050
The way I would write this down
with matrices would be as follows.

24
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.301
So I'd write it down as this matrix,
what I'm now calling a matrix,

25
00:01:31.301 --> 00:01:33.163
an object with numbers in 2 3 10 1.

26
00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:40.225
a b, = 8 13.

27
00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:44.085
And these things I call matrices.

28
00:01:44.085 --> 00:01:45.544
This is a 2 by 2 matrix.

29
00:01:45.544 --> 00:01:48.469
This is a 2 row by 1 column matrix.

30
00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.875
And this is another 2
row by 1 column matrix.

31
00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:56.858
And the instruction here is to multiply
this out in the following way.

32
00:01:56.858 --> 00:02:01.018
So I would multiply the elements in
the rows by the elements in the column.

33
00:02:01.018 --> 00:02:07.544
So I'd multiply 2 by a, plus 3 times b.

34
00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:09.681
So that row times that column, and

35
00:02:09.681 --> 00:02:13.414
I'd say that equaled the top
row on the right-hand side.

36
00:02:13.414 --> 00:02:19.750
And I do the same for the next row,
that row times that column is 10a plus 1b,

37
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.363
is equal to the row on the bottom
on the right-hand side.

38
00:02:24.363 --> 00:02:27.314
And that looks like my two
simultaneous equations.

39
00:02:29.097 --> 00:02:34.284
But this is really handy, because these
things, notice, look like vectors.

40
00:02:34.284 --> 00:02:38.900
So this matrix operates on this
vector to give this other vector, and

41
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.768
my question is, what vector transforms
to give me this guy on the right?

42
00:02:43.768 --> 00:02:48.924
Now let's look at what
happens if I multiply this

43
00:02:48.924 --> 00:02:54.975
matrix here by the unit basis vector,
the x axis vector.

44
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.323
Well when I do that multiplication,
I'm going to get 2 times 1 plus 3 times 0.

45
00:03:02.323 --> 00:03:06.693
And I'm going to get 10
times 1 plus 1 times 0.

46
00:03:06.693 --> 00:03:08.980
So I get the vector 2 10.

47
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.224
So what this does is it takes
the little unit vector which

48
00:03:14.224 --> 00:03:19.700
we called e1 hat, and
it transforms it to another place.

49
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.757
Which is 2 10,
which is going to be up here somewhere.

50
00:03:26.757 --> 00:03:33.242
So that's e1 hat, changed,
and that's equal to 2 10.

51
00:03:33.242 --> 00:03:38.173
Now if I do that with
the other basis vector.

52
00:03:38.173 --> 00:03:44.711
If I do 2 3 10 1 multiplied by 0 1.

53
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:50.804
Then I'm going to get 2 times
0 times plus 3 times 1.

54
00:03:50.804 --> 00:03:52.794
10 times 0 plus 1 times 1,
I'm going to get 3 1.

55
00:03:52.794 --> 00:03:57.915
So the other basis vector,
e2 hat, gets transformed

56
00:03:57.915 --> 00:04:02.937
over to 3 1,
which is going to be over here somewhere.

57
00:04:02.937 --> 00:04:10.418
So that's e2 changed, I'm using
the prime here to indicate changed, 3 1.

58
00:04:10.418 --> 00:04:15.074
So what this matrix does,
is it moves the basis vectors in some way,

59
00:04:15.074 --> 00:04:18.740
it transforms them, it changes the space.

60
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.160
So what this matrix 2 3 10 1 does

61
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.590
is it's a function that operates on input
vectors and gives us other output vectors.

62
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.937
And a set of simultaneous equations
here is asking, in effect,

63
00:04:31.937 --> 00:04:37.347
what vector I need in order to get a
transformed product at the position 8 13.

64
00:04:37.347 --> 00:04:39.537
In order to get an output of 8 13.

65
00:04:39.537 --> 00:04:44.810
Now we can see what we mean now
by the term linear algebra.

66
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.660
Linear algebra is linear, because it
just takes input values, our a and

67
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.280
b, and multiplies them by constants.

68
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.030
So everything is linear.

69
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.858
And it's algebra, that is it's a notation
describing mathematical objects and

70
00:04:58.858 --> 00:05:01.489
a system of manipulating those notations.

71
00:05:01.489 --> 00:05:04.778
So linear algebra is
a mathematical system for

72
00:05:04.778 --> 00:05:09.175
manipulating vectors in the spaces
described by vectors.

73
00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:10.620
So this is interesting.

74
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.630
There seems to be some kind of deep
connection between simultaneous equations,

75
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.055
these things called matrices, and the
vectors we were talking about last week.

76
00:05:19.055 --> 00:05:22.749
And it turns that the key to solving
simultaneous equation problems is

77
00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:25.755
appreciating how vectors
are transformed by matrices,

78
00:05:25.755 --> 00:05:27.769
which is the heart of linear algebra.
