00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:08.550
So, we've looked at the two main vector operations of addition and scaling by a number.

2
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.010
And those are all the things we really need to be able to

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.825
do to define what we mean by a vector,

4
00:00:13.825 --> 00:00:16.650
the mathematical properties a vector has.

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.225
Now, we can move on to define two things: the length of a vector,

6
00:00:22.225 --> 00:00:23.990
also called its size,

7
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.837
and the dot product of a vector,

8
00:00:25.837 --> 00:00:30.586
also called its inner, scalar or projection product.

9
00:00:30.586 --> 00:00:33.240
The dot product is a huge and amazing concept

10
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.905
in linear algebra with huge numbers of implications,

11
00:00:35.905 --> 00:00:38.965
and we'll only be able to touch on a few parts of it here, but enjoy.

12
00:00:38.965 --> 00:00:41.400
It's one of the most beautiful parts of linear algebra.

13
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.480
So, when we define the vector initially, this guy,

14
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.285
r, we did it without reference to any coordinate system.

15
00:00:50.285 --> 00:00:51.910
In fact, it's the geometric object,

16
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.460
this thing just has two properties: it's length here and its direction,

17
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.365
which is going this way as opposed to this way or this way.

18
00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:03.655
So, irrespective of the coordinate system we decided to use,

19
00:01:03.655 --> 00:01:05.485
we want to know how to calculate

20
00:01:05.485 --> 00:01:08.335
those two properties: its length and the direction it's going.

21
00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:12.295
Now, if the coordinate system that we used to define r,

22
00:01:12.295 --> 00:01:17.100
used these two vectors, r and j,

23
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.125
we can say that r is equal to ai plus bj,

24
00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:28.136
or is equal to a,b,

25
00:01:28.136 --> 00:01:31.035
the way we were writing it in the last video.

26
00:01:31.035 --> 00:01:33.950
Now, if we want to know the length of r,

27
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.565
well, we can draw a triangle, right? And then we can use Pythogoras' theorem.

28
00:01:36.565 --> 00:01:41.297
So, we've got ai's going along this way,

29
00:01:41.297 --> 00:01:43.685
and we've got bj's going along this way.

30
00:01:43.685 --> 00:01:46.730
And if i and j are both of unit length that the length of those is just

31
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:53.255
a here and b here where these vertical lines on either side means the size.

32
00:01:53.255 --> 00:01:55.592
So then, we can use Pythagoras' theorem just for

33
00:01:55.592 --> 00:01:59.015
a triangle where we've got a there, b there.

34
00:01:59.015 --> 00:02:01.995
This length then from Pythagoras' theorem will

35
00:02:01.995 --> 00:02:05.350
be the square root of a squared plus b squared.

36
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.820
And we can say that that's equal to the length of r,

37
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.990
it's the square root of a squared plus b squared.

38
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.895
So, the length of, r is equal to a,b. So, r is that.

39
00:02:17.895 --> 00:02:20.695
And the length of r, we defined to be equal to

40
00:02:20.695 --> 00:02:24.654
the square root of a squared plus b squared.

41
00:02:24.654 --> 00:02:29.350
Now, we've done this for two spatial directions defined by the unit vectors,

42
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.055
i and j, and those are at right angles to each other.

43
00:02:33.055 --> 00:02:36.810
But this definition of the size of a vector is more general than that.

44
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.785
It doesn't matter if the different components of the vector are

45
00:02:39.785 --> 00:02:41.980
dimensions in space or even things with

46
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.835
different, physical units like bedrooms or bathrooms or length and time and price,

47
00:02:45.835 --> 00:02:48.220
we still define the size of a vector through

48
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.720
the sums of the squares of its components, all square rooted.

49
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.820
The next thing we're going to do is define the dot product which is one way,

50
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.575
one way of several,

51
00:02:56.575 --> 00:02:59.023
of multiplying two vectors together.

52
00:02:59.023 --> 00:03:00.365
So, we've got two vectors here,

53
00:03:00.365 --> 00:03:03.330
r and s. I'm going to make this a bit more general, actually.

54
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.630
I'm going to give them components. So, I'm going to call it r_i, r_j.

55
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.175
So, r has a component i,

56
00:03:11.175 --> 00:03:13.740
in this case, 3, and a component j, in this case, 2

57
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.625
in the j directions and the i directions, respectively.

58
00:03:17.625 --> 00:03:19.560
And s, we could do the same thing.

59
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.460
We could say s has components s_i and s_j.

60
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:30.670
So then, we define the dot product,

61
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.605
and the product is just a number, like 3.

62
00:03:33.605 --> 00:03:39.369
It doesn't have any associated spatial dimension or direction along the vectors i and j.

63
00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:44.180
We'll define the dot product r dot s, to be equal to,

64
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:51.590
what happens if I multiply r_i by s_i,

65
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.460
and add it

66
00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:03.450
to r_j times s_j.

67
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.770
So, in this case, that gives me,

68
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:12.875
in this case it gives me three there times minus one,

69
00:04:12.875 --> 00:04:18.000
plus two times two.

70
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.255
So, that gives me three plus four - sorry, minus three plus four, which is equal to one.

71
00:04:25.255 --> 00:04:27.520
So, the dot product of r dot s,

72
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.285
in this case, is minus three plus four, which is one.

73
00:04:32.285 --> 00:04:35.008
Now, we can go on to look at one property of

74
00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:39.439
the dot product which is that it's commutative.

75
00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:44.720
So, commutative which is spelled commutative.

76
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.520
And that means that r dot s

77
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.225
is equal to s dot r. It doesn't matter which way around we do it.

78
00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:55.300
And we can see that fairly simply because if we just switch that around,

79
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.005
we'd have s_i times r_i,

80
00:04:59.005 --> 00:05:00.715
plus s_j times r_j,

81
00:05:00.715 --> 00:05:02.335
and that's going to be the same number.

82
00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:04.375
So, we can see immediately,

83
00:05:04.375 --> 00:05:07.080
fairly trivially, that the dot product is commutative.

84
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.305
It doesn't matter which order we do it in.

85
00:05:09.305 --> 00:05:11.030
The second property we're going to prove is

86
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.870
the dot product is distributive over addition.

87
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.015
So, if I have some third vector,

88
00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:17.890
let's take some third vector, t,

89
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:24.310
what being distributive means is

90
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:33.755
that r dot s plus t is the same as r dot s plus r dot t. That is,

91
00:05:33.755 --> 00:05:38.895
we can multiply out this bracket in the way that we would if they were just numbers.

92
00:05:38.895 --> 00:05:43.085
And we're going to prove this in the general case for any dimension vectors.

93
00:05:43.085 --> 00:05:50.100
So, we'll have a vector r is equal to the components r_1,

94
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.361
r_2, for i's and j's,

95
00:05:51.361 --> 00:05:54.325
all way up to some dimension r_n.

96
00:05:54.325 --> 00:05:58.570
And s is some other vector, s_1,

97
00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.953
s_2, all the way up to some s _n.

98
00:06:02.953 --> 00:06:09.540
And t is another one which is equal to t_1,

99
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.310
t_2, all the way up to some component t_n.

100
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.930
And then, r dot s plus t

101
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:27.430
is going to be equal to r_1 times s_1 plus t_1,

102
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.325
plus r_2, for the second dimension,

103
00:06:30.325 --> 00:06:33.205
times s_2 plus t_2,

104
00:06:33.205 --> 00:06:35.965
plus all the other dimensions,

105
00:06:35.965 --> 00:06:41.050
plus r_n times s_n plus t_n,

106
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.300
if I multiply it out for all the dimensions.

107
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.600
And then, I can just multiply out those brackets,

108
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.725
that's going to be r_1 s_1 plus r_1 t_1,

109
00:06:50.725 --> 00:06:52.790
plus, now multiply out this bracket,

110
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:57.910
r_2 s_2 plus r_2 t_2,

111
00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.800
plus, all the dots,

112
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.450
r_n s_n plus r_n t_n.

113
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:08.165
And if I collect together the rs term,

114
00:07:08.165 --> 00:07:11.000
so I've got r_1 s_1, r_2 s_2, and r_n s_n,

115
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.230
so that's r dot s,

116
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.940
and if I collect all the t terms together,

117
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.870
I've got r dot t. So,

118
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.790
we've demonstrated that this distributive property is in fact true.

119
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:29.395
So, it's also kind of obvious that if we multiply a vector through by a scalar,

120
00:07:29.395 --> 00:07:31.910
so if we take a times s,

121
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:37.270
our other fundamental operation was multiplying by a scalar,

122
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.555
and then do the dot product on that,

123
00:07:40.555 --> 00:07:42.130
so we do r dot a s,

124
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:52.175
then that's going to be equal to a times r dot s. Because if we take this s here,

125
00:07:52.175 --> 00:07:54.695
when we do this, if we multiply s here,

126
00:07:54.695 --> 00:07:56.000
through by a number, a,

127
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.605
we're just going to get the number a come out of all the components.

128
00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:10.723
So, that's going to be if we do it r_i times as_i plus r_j times as_j,

129
00:08:10.723 --> 00:08:12.740
that's the left-hand side,

130
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:20.385
and that's equal to a times r_i s_i plus r_j s_j.

131
00:08:20.385 --> 00:08:25.510
So, that is, this property is called that it's

132
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:34.011
associative over scalar multiplication.

133
00:08:34.011 --> 00:08:38.430
Over scalar, that's the number a, multiplication.

134
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:41.445
So, we've got three properties.

135
00:08:41.445 --> 00:08:44.120
We've got it's associative over scalar multiplication,

136
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.715
the dot product is distributive, and it's commutative.

137
00:08:47.715 --> 00:08:50.210
Now, the last thing we need to do is draw the link

138
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:53.320
between the dot product and the size of the vector.

139
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.248
This is quite surprising!

140
00:08:55.248 --> 00:08:58.880
If we take r and dot it with itself,

141
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.015
we get r_i times r_i,

142
00:09:02.015 --> 00:09:04.170
plus r_j times r_j,

143
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:06.650
plus all the other components, whatever they are.

144
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:12.295
So, that's equal to r_i squared plus r_j squared.

145
00:09:12.295 --> 00:09:15.630
But we said that the size of the vector was the square root of that.

146
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:22.856
So, r dot r is equal to the size of the vector squared.

147
00:09:22.856 --> 00:09:24.530
So, that is

148
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.150
the size of the vector is just given,

149
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:30.820
in some senses, by r dotted with itself, which is quite cool.
