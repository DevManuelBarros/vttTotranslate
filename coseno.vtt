2
00:00:02.303 --> 00:00:04.563
Let's take the cosine rule from algebra,

3
00:00:04.563 --> 00:00:08.160
which you'll remember
probably vaguely from school.

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.217
And that said if we had
a triangle with sides a,

5
00:00:13.217 --> 00:00:17.896
b, and c, then what the cosine rule said,

6
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:26.950
Was that c squared =
a squared + b squared-

7
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:32.473
2ab times the cos of
the angle between a and

8
00:00:32.473 --> 00:00:36.630
b, cos that angle theta there.

9
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.830
Now, we can translate that
into our vector notation.

10
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.702
If we call this vector r here,
and we call this vector s here.

11
00:00:48.702 --> 00:00:52.980
Then this vector will be minus s plus r,
so

12
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.152
that vector would be r-s, minus s + r.

13
00:00:57.152 --> 00:01:04.860
So we could say that c squared
was the modulus of r-s squared.

14
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.050
And that would be equal to
the modulus, the size, of r squared

15
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.500
plus the size of s squared -2 mod r

16
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.230
mod s cos theta.

17
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.620
Now, here's the cool bit.

18
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.180
We can multiply this out using
our dot product, because we know

19
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.240
that the size of (r- s) squared is
equal to (r- s) dotted with itself.

20
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.900
Now, that's just that.

21
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.051
And we can multiply that out, and

22
00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:38.875
then we'll compare it to
this right hand side here.

23
00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:45.385
So (r- s).(r- s), well that's going to be,

24
00:01:45.385 --> 00:01:51.740
if, we need to figure out
how to multiply that out,

25
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.390
that's going to be equal to r.r, and

26
00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.452
then take the next one, -s.r -s.r again.

27
00:02:02.452 --> 00:02:09.252
If you take that -s and that r, -s.r,

28
00:02:09.252 --> 00:02:14.053
again, and then -s.-s.

29
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:23.023
So that is, we've got the modulus
of r squared here and

30
00:02:23.023 --> 00:02:30.248
we dot r with itself, -2s.r and
then -s.-s.

31
00:02:30.248 --> 00:02:33.162
Well, that's going to be
the size of -s squared,

32
00:02:33.162 --> 00:02:35.306
which is just the size of s squared.

33
00:02:38.768 --> 00:02:42.284
And then we can compare that
to the right-hand side.

34
00:02:42.284 --> 00:02:46.468
And when we do that comparison,
compare that to the right-hand side,

35
00:02:46.468 --> 00:02:49.829
the -r squareds are going to cancel,
the r squareds, even.

36
00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.917
The s squareds are going to cancel, and

37
00:02:54.917 --> 00:03:00.334
so we get a result which is that -2s.r

38
00:03:00.334 --> 00:03:06.255
= -2 modulus of r modulus of s cos theta.

39
00:03:06.255 --> 00:03:09.540
And then we could lose the minus sign,
right?

40
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.010
Minus signs will cancel out.

41
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.471
Just multiply through by minus one and
then the 2s we can cancel out again.

42
00:03:18.828 --> 00:03:23.570
So we can say that the dot product r.s,

43
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:31.060
just to put it in a more familiar form,
= mod r mod s cos theta.

44
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.260
So what we found here is that the dot
product really does something quite

45
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.290
profound.

46
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.020
It takes the size of the two vectors,
if these were both unit length vectors,

47
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.130
those would be one, and multiplies
by cos of the angle between them.

48
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.910
It tells us something about
the extent to which the two

49
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.020
vectors go in the same direction.

50
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.159
because if theta was zero,
then cos theta would be one,

51
00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.541
and r.s would just be the size of
the two vectors multiplied together.

52
00:03:57.541 --> 00:04:03.354
If the two vectors, on the other hand,
were at 90 degrees to each other,

53
00:04:03.354 --> 00:04:09.167
if they were r was like this and s was
like this, and the angle between them,

54
00:04:09.167 --> 00:04:14.276
theta, was equal to 90 degrees,
cos theta, cos 90, is 0.

55
00:04:14.276 --> 00:04:19.761
And then r.s is going to be,
we could immediately see,

56
00:04:19.761 --> 00:04:25.159
r.s is going to be some size of r,
some size of s times 0.

57
00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:29.566
So if the two vectors are pointing at 90
degrees to each other, if they're what's

58
00:04:29.566 --> 00:04:33.680
called orthogonal to each other, then
the dot product's going to give me zero.

59
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:41.331
If they're both pointing in the same
direction, say s was like that,

60
00:04:41.331 --> 00:04:46.752
and the angle between them is nought,
cos 0 = 1.

61
00:04:46.752 --> 00:04:51.745
And then r.s, is

62
00:04:51.745 --> 00:04:57.010
equal to mod r times mod s, just the
multiplication of the two sizes together.

63
00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.829
Fun one, last fun one here, is that r and
s are in the opposite directions.

64
00:05:01.829 --> 00:05:07.571
So let's say s was now going this way and

65
00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:14.013
the angle between them was 180 degrees.

66
00:05:14.013 --> 00:05:19.141
Cos 180 degrees = -1, so then r.s would

67
00:05:19.141 --> 00:05:24.539
be equal to minus the size
of r times the size of s.

68
00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.742
And so what the dot product here really
does with this cos, it tells us when we

69
00:05:28.742 --> 00:05:32.627
get the minus sign out,
that they're going in opposite directions.

70
00:05:32.627 --> 00:05:37.219
So there's some property here in
the dot product we've derived by

71
00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:40.910
looking at the cosine rule
that we've derived here.

72
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.930
When the dot product's 0, they're at
90 degrees to each other, orthogonal.

73
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.562
When they're going the same way,
we get a positive answer.

74
00:05:46.562 --> 00:05:48.571
When they're going more or
less in opposite directions,

75
00:05:48.571 --> 00:05:50.129
we get a negative answer for
the dot product.

76
00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:53.224
