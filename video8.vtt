2
00:00:02.662 --> 00:00:07.227
So we've seen how we don't just have to
have basis vectors that are our normal 1,0 and

3
00:00:07.227 --> 00:00:10.200
0,1, the so-called natural basis here.

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.765
We can have different basis vectors that
redefine how we we move about space.

5
00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:18.295
In this video, what we're going to do is
we are going to define what we mean by

6
00:00:18.295 --> 00:00:23.565
a basis, by a vector space, and
by the term linear independence, which

7
00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:29.265
is going to let us understand how many
dimensions our vector space actually has.

8
00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:33.385
So first let's define
what we mean by a basis.

9
00:00:33.385 --> 00:00:39.290
A basis is a set of n vectors that are not
linear combinations of each other,

10
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.980
which means they're
linearly independent and

11
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.580
that they span the space
that they describe.

12
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.380
The space is then n-dimensional.

13
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.824
The first criteria I can write
down by saying that if they're

14
00:00:51.824 --> 00:00:53.244
linearly independent,

15
00:00:53.244 --> 00:00:57.377
then I can't write any of them by
taking some combination of the others.

16
00:00:57.377 --> 00:01:02.125
For example, if I had a candidate, b3,

17
00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:09.469
it would be linearly dependent
on the basis vectors b1 and b2,

18
00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:14.706
if I could take some combination
of them a1b1s + a2b2s,

19
00:01:14.706 --> 00:01:19.326
where a1 and a2 are numbers,
if I could take a linear

20
00:01:19.326 --> 00:01:23.964
combination of b1 and
b2 like this, and find b3,

21
00:01:23.964 --> 00:01:28.728
then, b3 would be linearly
dependent on b1 and b2.

22
00:01:28.728 --> 00:01:33.440
It wouldn't be an independent vector,
so it's some vector.

23
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.390
I can sketch it out by
doing something like this.

24
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.162
If I've got b1 here, and
say b2 here, if b3, I can find by

25
00:01:42.162 --> 00:01:48.800
some combination of b1 and

26
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.955
b2s, it must lie on the same plane as b1
and b2, all right, the plane of my board.

27
00:01:53.955 --> 00:01:56.585
If b3's actually lying
out of the plane here,

28
00:01:56.585 --> 00:02:01.825
I couldn't make the out-of-plane
component of it using my b1s and b2s.

29
00:02:01.825 --> 00:02:06.605
So b3 would then be linearly
independent of b1 and b2.

30
00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:11.410
This = I couldn't ever make true, and
then b3 would lie outside of the plane.

31
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.640
I'd then have three basis vectors.

32
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.050
Those three would then define a three
dimensional vector space, and

33
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.480
I could get anywhere
in 3D space with them.

34
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.370
And then if I had another basis vector,
b4, that wasn't a linear combination of

35
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.610
b1, b2, and b3, then b4 would then let
me have a four-dimensional space and

36
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.290
so on and so
on to as many dimensions as I like.

37
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.220
Then a vector is in the vector
space spanned by b1 and

38
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.090
b2 if it can be found by a linear
combination of b1s and b2s.

39
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.360
Now, notice what my basis
vectors b don't have to be.

40
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.830
They don't have to be unit vectors,
by which I mean vectors of length 1.

41
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.430
And they don't have to be orthogonal,
at 90 degrees to each other,

42
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.030
normal to each other.

43
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.680
But everything is going to
be much easier if they are.

44
00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.850
So if at all possible,

45
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.130
you want to construct what's called
an orthonormal basic vector set

46
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.460
where they're all at 90 degrees to
each other and all of unit length.

47
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.560
Now, let's think about what happens
when we map from one basis to another.

48
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.930
The number line of the axes
of the original grid

49
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.180
then projects down onto the new grid,
like here.

50
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.530
And potentially has different
values on that grid, but

51
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.520
the projection keeps the grid
being evenly spaced.

52
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.630
Therefore, any mapping that we do
from one set of basis vectors,

53
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.240
one coordinate system to another set of
basis vectors, another coordinate system,

54
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.050
keeps the vector space being
a regularly spaced grid, where

55
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.990
our original rules of vector addition and
multiplication by a scaler still work.

56
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.880
It doesn't warp or fold space,

57
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.350
which is what the linear bit in
linear algebra means geometrically.

58
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.230
Things might be stretched or
rotated or inverted, but

59
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.057
everything remains evenly spaced and
linear combinations still work.

60
00:03:57.057 --> 00:04:01.190
Now, when the new basis vectors aren't
orthogonal, then to do the change from one

61
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.748
base to another, we won't just be
able to use the dot product anymore.

62
00:04:04.748 --> 00:04:09.540
We'll have to use matrices instead,
which we'll meet in the next module.

63
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.275
So that's the formal definition
of what we mean by a basis and

64
00:04:13.275 --> 00:04:14.896
by linear independence.

65
00:04:14.896 --> 00:04:18.458
