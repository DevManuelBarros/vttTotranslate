2
00:00:02.496 --> 00:00:04.983
Previously we introduced
the idea of a matrix and

3
00:00:04.983 --> 00:00:08.458
related it to the problem of
solving simultaneous equations.

4
00:00:08.458 --> 00:00:12.958
And we showed that the columns of a matrix
just read us what it does to the unit

5
00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:15.490
vector along each axis.

6
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.290
Now we'll look at different types of
matrices and what they do to space.

7
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.290
And what happens if we apply
one matrix transformation and

8
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.842
then another, which is termed composition.

9
00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:28.812
Now because we could make any
vector out of a vector sum of

10
00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:31.866
the scaled versions of e1 hat and e2 hat.

11
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:36.932
Then what that means is the result of
the transformation is just going to be

12
00:00:36.932 --> 00:00:42.092
some sum of the transform vectors,
which I'm calling e1 hat and e2 hat.

13
00:00:42.092 --> 00:00:44.020
This is a bit hard to see but

14
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:50.010
what it means is that the grid lines of
our space stay parallel and evenly spaced.

15
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.461
They might be stretched or sheared,
but the origin stays where it is and

16
00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:56.699
there isn't any curviness to the space,
it doesn't get warped.

17
00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.626
And that's a consequence of our scalar
addition and multiplication rules for

18
00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:01.760
vectors.

19
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.671
So that is if I write down
the matrix as capital A and

20
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:09.780
the vector its transforming is r,
whatever it was.

21
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.630
a b in our apples and bananas problem.

22
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.575
And that gives me some altered version.

23
00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:22.312
We said it was 8 13 before, but I'm
going to call it r transformed or r prime.

24
00:01:22.312 --> 00:01:25.380
Then we can look at what happens
when I do algebra with it.

25
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.213
So if I multiply r by some number,
just a number, let's call it n.

26
00:01:34.358 --> 00:01:38.521
And if I apply A to (nr), what I'm
saying is that I will get nr prime.

27
00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:42.249
And hopefully you can see
if I put an n in there,

28
00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:46.562
when I multiply it all out I'm
going to get an n in there.

29
00:01:46.562 --> 00:01:50.984
Similarly, if I multiply

30
00:01:50.984 --> 00:01:55.406
A by the vector (r+s),

31
00:01:55.406 --> 00:01:59.431
then I will get Ar + As.

32
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:04.368
So if I get that multiplication, get that,
do the whole thing again with another

33
00:02:04.368 --> 00:02:08.884
vector, and get another vector s, and
add those two, that will be true.

34
00:02:08.884 --> 00:02:13.756
So what I'm saying here is that
if I can then think of these

35
00:02:13.756 --> 00:02:18.728
as being the original basis vectors,
e1 hat and e2 hat,

36
00:02:18.728 --> 00:02:23.110
I'll then get some addition of e2 and
e1 primed.

37
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:30.934
So if I say that's ne1 hat + me2 hat,

38
00:02:30.934 --> 00:02:37.573
I'll get nAe1 hat + mAe2 hat,

39
00:02:37.573 --> 00:02:45.660
which is ne1 prime + me2 primed.

40
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.880
Which is just the vector sum
of some multiple of those.

41
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.112
So the space gets transformed,
e1 and e2 get moved.

42
00:02:57.112 --> 00:03:00.217
And then I can just add
up vectors with them.

43
00:03:00.217 --> 00:03:05.756
So that's very nice, that means that
all of our vector sum rules work.

44
00:03:05.756 --> 00:03:09.330
Now maybe that's a bit confusing so
let's try it with an example.

45
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.900
So I've got my matrix A here
from my apples bananas problem.

46
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.695
So I have 2 3 10 1, or if we like,
the vector 2 10 and the vector 3 1.

47
00:03:19.695 --> 00:03:24.886
Now let's try an example
like a vector 3 2.

48
00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:29.796
Now if I multiply that out
just straightforwardly,

49
00:03:29.796 --> 00:03:33.720
as we probably did at school,
I've got 2 times 3 plus 3 times 2.

50
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.087
So that's 6 plus 6, that's 12.

51
00:03:36.087 --> 00:03:40.510
And I've got 10 times 3, which is 30,
plus 1 times 2, which is 2.

52
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.018
So that's 32.

53
00:03:43.018 --> 00:03:50.103
But I could think of
that as being 2 3 10 1,

54
00:03:50.103 --> 00:03:56.480
times (3 times 1 0 + 2 times 0 1).

55
00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:03.718
That is, 3 of our e1 hat and
2 of e2 hat in a vector sum.

56
00:04:03.718 --> 00:04:08.477
Now I can take the 3 out so

57
00:04:08.477 --> 00:04:13.011
that's 3 times 

58
00:04:13.011 --> 00:04:17.327
(2 3 10 1 times 1 0).

59
00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:24.423
+ 2 times (2 3 10

60
00:04:24.423 --> 00:04:29.174
1 times 0 1).

61
00:04:32.903 --> 00:04:37.903
And this, we know that this
is what happens from e1 hat

62
00:04:37.903 --> 00:04:42.806
to get to e1 prime here,
so that's 3 times 2 10.

63
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:51.996
And that's 2 times what happens to e2 hat,
and that goes to 3 1.

64
00:04:53.463 --> 00:04:58.727
So that gives us 6 plus 6 is 12 and

65
00:04:58.727 --> 00:05:01.891
30 plus 2 is 32.

66
00:05:01.891 --> 00:05:05.610
So it really is true,
these rules really do work.

67
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.893
We can think of a matrix multiplication
as just being the multiplication

68
00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:14.710
of the vector sum of
the transformed basis vectors.

69
00:05:16.458 --> 00:05:20.020
So pause now for a moment and try that
maybe with an example of your own.

70
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.869
And verify that that really does work
because that's really quite deep.

71
00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:27.410
This matrix just tells us
where the basis vectors go.

72
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.170
That's the transformation it does.

73
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.090
It's not a complicated,
multiplying out thing.

74
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.660
We don't need to worry about
the mechanics of doing the sum.

75
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.909
We can just think of it in terms of
what it does to vectors in the space.

76
00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.769
